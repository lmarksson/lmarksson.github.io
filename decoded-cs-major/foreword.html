      <div><h1 class="centered-text">Foreword</h1><p>Computer science is one of the hottest majors today. Some people enjoy programming and naturally gravitate towards the major. Others want to revolutionize the world with groundbreaking technology. But above all, many people chase the enormous salaries that a degree in computer science commands. If the job prospects appeal to you, then you’ve picked up the right book!</p><h2>Who Should Read This Book?</h2><p>Let’s be practical: people pursue degrees because they want a stable, well-paying job after graduation. Studying computer science gets you just that. If you’re a computer science student or someone considering college computer science in the future, then this is the guide for you. Rather than wasting time discovering everything on your own during college, read this book to get a head start. You can understand most parts of the college computer science major before you even head off to college. If you’re a parent and want your child to study computer science, this is also the book both you and your child should read. Support your child and help them apply the tips outlined here. Most people only get one shot at college, so make the most of it by preparing in advance with this book. Investing a few days reading this today can yield immense dividends.</p><h2>What Is This Book About?</h2><p>Many people pursue computer science and many don’t do it right. Some try coding, get scared, and choose another major. Others attempt the coursework and flunk out. Worst of all, I see plenty of students grind through four years of coursework and still struggle to get a job in an environment where every company left and right is hiring software engineers. This book discusses how to correctly approach the computer science major and set your career up for success.</p><p>Most people have four years of college to build towards their full-time job; once a year of college is over, it’s over, so avoid costly mistakes that waste your limited time. Sometimes the student shares the blame: not studying, partying too much, or getting caught cheating. But pretty much every case involves lack of proper mentorship. With the right motivation and the right guidance from this book over four years of college, any student can reach entry-level competency in computer science and snag a solid software job.</p><p>College isn’t just about academics; everything from your goals to your finances to how you search for internships influences your success. This book teaches you how to navigate all the dimensions. I’ll build from the ground up and start with your personal compass: motivation, setting goals, working towards goals, and not letting your emotions knock you off track. Then, I’ll discuss different facets of college: academics, social life, physical health, and finances. You’re better off reading about these tips and tricks instead of realizing them after most of your college experience is over. Finally, I’ll provide concrete guidelines and goals for your four years of college so that you have a path to follow.</p><h2>Can Anyone Be a Good Programmer?</h2><p>At this point, many people will say, “But I can’t be a great programmer.” I’ve heard all sorts of excuses:</p><ul><li>My brain doesn’t think correctly for programming</li><li>I’m the wrong gender or race</li><li>I did poorly in my MATLAB course so I clearly can’t program</li></ul><p>It’s all in your head! None of these are true, and even if you truly aren’t a good programmer, that doesn’t matter. You don’t have to be a genius to snag a great software job. Practically all companies need software engineers these days and software jobs outnumber computer science graduates many times over.</p><p>If every company paid six- or seven-digit salaries for artwork, I would quit my software job and put in my eight hours a day painting even though I have no sense of artistic style. Similarly, you don’t have to be anywhere near a programming god to complete a computer science degree and hold a software job.</p><p>The only things you need to succeed in the computer science major are willpower and guidance. You’ll have to provide the willpower because success never comes for free; however, the first section of this book provides plenty of motivation for staying strong and sticking with the major. Then, the remainder of this book provides all the advice that you don’t get from advisors, friends, and parents. You’ll learn about the techniques I’ve seen work well and the ideas you’ll want to discover before your freshman year of college instead of after your senior year. Never forget: anyone can succeed at the computer science major — it’s all about your approach.</p></div>
