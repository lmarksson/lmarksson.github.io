      <div><h1 class="centered-text">Part III: College Strategy</h1><p>In part I of the book, I gave you the motivation to pursue the computer science major. On average, getting a degree in computer science and unlocking a career in software leads to more money than any other discipline. Software also offers unparalleled opportunities to make an impact on the world and programming can be enjoyable too. Even if writing software is not something you want to dedicate your life to, once you have your money dimension satisfied, you can devote evenings and weekends or even retire early to pursue your true calling. The world doesn’t hand you everything you want on a golden platter; for most people, pursuing a computer science major and beginning a career in software is the optimal gateway to getting what you want.</p><p>In part II of the book, I gave you a general framework for achieving goals in your life. Start with your lofty goals, break them down into smaller and smaller subgoals until you can connect them into a clear path to your ultimate goal. After you set the right goals, you have to get the execution right. First and foremost, don’t let your emotions derail you. Second, know that not everything is within your control; break down interactions with others into transactions: understand what other people want and what you get in return. Finally, accept that failure will happen, but analyze why you failed, learn to prevent them in the future, and grow stronger. Should you choose to apply these techniques to the best of your ability, you’ll notice stronger direction in your life, and progress towards your goals faster than ever before.</p><p>In part II, I also stated that breaking down lofty goals into smaller stepping stones is impossible if you have no idea what’s coming down the line. If your high-level goal is to major in computer science, then you must understand what college is all about. That’s where part III comes into play:</p><p><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" title=""/></p><p>In part III of this book, I’ll cover the major dimensions of college: academics, mental health, physical health, finances, and internships. You may not have gone through college yet, but I have done so and gotten my degree in computer science. I also know many other people from a variety of backgrounds who have done so. As discussed in part II, leverage the experiences of those who have already walked the path that you plan on taking. Use the knowledge in part III to create your stepping stones to your computer science degree and software career.</p></div>
